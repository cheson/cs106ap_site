<h1>CS106A Syllabus</h1>


<p>
CS106AP introduces computer programming
for people who have not programmed before.
To learn programming, you need to do a lot of
guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand - that's CS106A!
This quarter's CS106AP is a new experimental course using
the Python language and "lab" style coding in lecture.
It is still CS106A, just trying a new strategy.


</p><p>
Students who already have significant programming
experience should probably take another course,
such as CME 193.
There's also a "java" CS106A this quarter which
is a very polished, well-worked out course.

Key course facts...

</p><p>Nick Parlante, nick.parlante@cs.stanford.edu, Gates 189
<br>I'll hang around  at the end of class for questions

</p><h2>Topics</h2>

<p>We will cover all the important topics of basic programming
in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic,
decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing,
debugging, performance.


</p><h2>Experimental</h2>

<p>This is a new experimental draft form of the course this quarter!
New lectures, new assignments, new labs .. new everything.
The course is also offered in the spring, so you could take it then
in a less-experimental form (with no enrollment limit).

</p><h2>Section</h2>

<p>There will be a weekly section, signups TBD.
You will have your own section leader for the quarter
who will lead section and grade your homeworks.


</p><h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Nick's experimental lab-code machinery is hosted at
parlante.org for now. We will also be using web-html
notes each day as our book.

</p><h2>Python 3</h2>

<p>We will use Python version 3. At first you will just use
parlante.org so you don't need to install anything.
Later we will do larger exercises where you will need
a computer with Python 3 installed on it. We'll have detailed
instructions for that when we get there.


</p><h2>Lab In Lecture</h2>

<p>It's best to bring a laptop to lecture.
We will experiment integrating little exercises
with lecture. In some cases, these little exercises
will need to be turned in as homework, so in effect,
we'll use some lecture time to progress on homework
exercises.

</p><h2>Homework</h2>

<p>We will have approximately weekly programming assignments.
We will also have small in-class programming exercises
which may be due just a day after they are assigned.
These will be very small.

</p><h2>Exams</h2>

<p>There will be a midterm and a final.

</p><h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Homework 40%

</p><p>Section 5%

</p><p>Exams 55%

</p><h2>Honor Code</h2>

<p>In the spirit of collegial and cooperative learning, you are free to 
discuss ideas and approaches with other students, and then implement the
 solution yourself. The key is this: <b>all the code you submit you should type in and get working yourself</b>. In particular, 
it is not ok to share or paste in someone else's code. It is not ok to look at someone else's code and type it in as your own.

</p><p>
The Computer Science department produces many honor code cases at 
Stanford. This is not because CS is a magnet for cheating; it's just 
that online submissions provide a large body of evidence, and computer 
science has tools which do an extremely good job of finding cheating.

</p><p>Each homework submission has a section where you can write notes 
for the grader. If you think a bit of collaboration may have crossed the
 line, mention it in your README notes for that homework. You can never 
get in honor code trouble for collaboration clearly descried in this 
way.

</p><p>For this quarter, CS106AP exams will very much resemble the 
homework problems. So that's an additional reason you need to author and
 understand your own code.

</p><p><b>It's not a person, it's a moment</b>

</p><h2>Lateness</h2>

<p>Worked turned in by the due date will get a 5% on-time bonus. The 5% 
is small enough that will be unlikely to change anyone's grade, it's 
just a token reward for people who start the work early enough to finish
 on time. After the due date, each assignment will have a "grace 
period", 48 hours unless documented otherwise. You need to turn in the 
homework by the end of the grace period. Even work which does not 
function perfectly can get a lot more points than zero, so you should 
turn in what you have. And of course contact staff to arrange extra time
 for extraordinary circumstances.




</p><h2>Topics and Weekly Schedule</h2>


<p>Below is a draft topic plan, more vague than it would be for an
established course. The pace is very TBD as we experiment with this
lab format. There is plenty of time in 10 weeks to cover all the important
Python topics we need however. The exam dates are fixed.
